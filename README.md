- (Center) MORA encourages the child to practice the target sound in complex forms, such as words and sentences in narratives.
- (Right) Enabling home-based practice within natural contexts reinforces the generalization of speech sounds.
- (Left) Speech-language-pathologist (SLP) configures the story with target sounds.
- (Bottom) Child practices at home with the aid of caregivers. SLP asynchronously monitors the progress and can adjust the therapy goal.

- SLP configures the story with prepared templates, target sounds, and customized target words.
- For home practice, the story is served with multimodal features.
- Child records and interacts with the system and practices words outside of the clinic.
- Analyzed information such as transcription, phonemic score labels, is served to the SLP.
